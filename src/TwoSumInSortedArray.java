/**
 * Created by xz346 on 6/1/15.
 * Requirement: TwoSum but given a sorted array
 *
 * A : Since TwoSum is all about a fast and efficient search, and there are two types of search algorithms: algorithms that donâ€™t make any assumptions about the order of
       the list (use LinearSort O(N)),and algorithms that assume the list is already in order (use Binary Sort O(logN)).
